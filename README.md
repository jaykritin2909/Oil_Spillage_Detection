# Oil_Spillage_Detection
A system for detecting oil spills in oceans using satellite imaging, machine learning, and remote sensing technologies to protect the marine environment.
To Detect whether an image has oil spill in it or not. It is equipped with the dataset scraped from various sources(250 images). It uses CNN, remote sensing technologies along with PyTorch-which is a powerful open-source machine learning library primarily used for building and training deep learning models.
